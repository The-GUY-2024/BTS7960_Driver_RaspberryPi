BTS7960 is a  high-power drive full H-bridge driver module with thermal over-current protection


# Description
This is simple explanation on how to use the BTS7960 with the raspberry pi is a very simple task 
(i'm doing this to simplify your life)



# Connection Schematic
VCC = 5v raspberry pi
GND = GND raspberry pi
raspberry pi pin mode is BCM 

* This are the enable pin's 

* BCM pin (20) = Driver pin (R_EN) 

* BCM pin (21) = Driver pin (L_EN)
             
* This are the Movement pin 

* BCM pin (19) = Driver pin (RPWM)

* BCM pin (26) = Driver pin (LPWM)
